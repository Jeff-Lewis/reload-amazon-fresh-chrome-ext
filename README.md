# reload amazon fresh until delivery times appear

It plays a loud alert mp3 when it finds availability. Refreshes every 30 seconds by default.
You can modify this in the options page.

## Installing and running
Install this chrome ext using developer mode (install unpacked).
Go to the amazon checkout page and you'll see this if it's working:

If availability is found, it plays a loud alert and tells you in the UI, too.
